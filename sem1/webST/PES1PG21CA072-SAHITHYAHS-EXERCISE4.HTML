            </span><p><span class="headline hl4">NEW DELHI: </span></p></div>
            The Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) on Tuesday made <mark>three demands</mark> to end their strike — a confirmed date for NEET PG counselling after the Supreme Court hearing on January 6, an apology from authorities and withdrawal of FIRs against protesting doctors.

The doctors who are protesting the delay in NEET PG counselling announced a complete shutdown of health care facilities on Monday after hundreds of doctors taking out a protest march were allegedly thrashed and dragged on the road by police personnel. The police, however, maintained that only minimal force was used to prevent protesters from moving towards the Supreme Court, and added that all those detained were released the same day.

<mark>The NEET PG counselling has repeatedly been delayed</mark> due to a bunch of cases in the Supreme Court looking at the economic reservation. Resident doctors have been protesting against the delay for over a month now, and have withdrawn from even emergency services.</p></article></div>

            The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic challenged the traditional healthcare systems across the world, affecting the private as well as public healthcare setups. The traditional healthcare eco-system heavily depends on secondary and tertiary care infrastructure to offer critical care and unfortunately, the two waves of COVID-19 completely crippled this system, and it is still grappling to revive itself.

Therefore, not only has healthcare suffered losses, but an overburdened workforce, stretched resources and disruption of normalcy has forced the healthcare systems to move towards innovative solutions.

            <p>  The Indian healthtech market is estimately growing at 39 % CAGR to reach $5 billion by 2023.

            Digital and technological innovation in the healthcare industry in 2021 has provided a light of hope in the sector that will help in enhancing performance and delivery to both doctors and patients respectively.The Healthcare industry is now backed by digital solutions, electronic medical records, medical data, and this creates a demand for an efficient workforce to be successful with these elements. As per the IAMAI-Praxis report, Health-tech is currently addressing three major challenges in the healthcare system i.e., accessibility, affordability and quality. With increased tech adoption, increased use of AI/ML and data collection, the health-tech industry is expected to develop into value-based healthcare at a reduced cost of care.

            The ultimate aim is to advance the healthcare sector with innovations and appropriate human resources. As per reports, India’s health system is struggling with low numbers of trained healthcare personnel. Genuine skilling/upskilling will lead to better resource management. Traditional teaching methods create the base but to endure the dynamic and evolving methods in healthcare, both soft skills and technical skills training is essential.</p>

            Boland, only the second Indigenous Australian to play a men’s Test, came off with a prize stump and astonishing innings figures of 6-7 as England capitulated for 68 before lunch on day three, their 13th lowest total in tests. “I thought we had a pretty good chance of winning but I had no idea we would do it before lunch,” said 32-year-old Boland, who was named the player of the match. Australia sealed the series 3-0 in front of a festive Boxing Day test crowd of 42,000, leaving England playing for pride in the final two tests in Sydney and Brisbane.</p></div>

            Orbiting more than 300 miles (480 kilometers) over Earth and separated by tens of millions of light-years from many of the interstellar objects it studies, the Hubble Space Telescope takes "working remotely" to a new extreme. Even as the world below grappled with another pandemic year, weird and wonderful space discoveries flooded in from above, with astronomers pulling back the curtain on monster black holes, invisible magnetic megastructures and a cosmic treasure trove of extraterrestrial planets. 

As a reminder that the universe just gets stranger and stranger the farther you get from Earth, here are 10 of the most awesome, extreme and enigmatic space structures discovered in 2021.
